			<p> Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old
				World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015. These species come in a range of colors,
				and many species have the ability to change color.

				Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their swaying gait;[2] and crests or horns on
				their brow and snout. Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail.
				Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in
				coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.</p>

			<p> Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species
				to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human
				alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
				Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as
				using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that
				they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even
				changing direction at junctions.</p>

			<p> A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as
				"humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and
				meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their
				desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving
				species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the
				two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now
				critically endangered.</p>
